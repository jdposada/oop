## What you will learn

In this course you will learn the basics of Object Oriented Programming

## Course Description

In this course we study the concepts on which object oriented programming theory is centered, such as: abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, among others. This study of the topics is carried out through a gradual process from the concept of classes and objects to the construction of object-oriented software.

The course has two great moments. The first part is focused on giving the student the theoretical tools and principles for the design of solutions to problems, through UML diagrams and their implementation in software. In the second part, the student focuses on software development from a proposed design using standard design patterns, testing their ability to interpret the designs at the time of implementation.

## Course Justification

Traditional techniques (structured or procedural programming) for application development tend to produce fragile systems that are difficult to maintain, especially when their size is relatively large. Object-oriented programming emerges as a programming paradigm that helps mitigate the shortcomings of previous techniques and helps build quality software.

## Main Outcome

Students who successfully complete this course will be able to apply and interpret the concepts of Object Oriented Programming in the solution design processes and in the development of applications, in accordance with clear requirements and following engineering standards.

# Learning Outcomes

- **CO1** Clearly define the basic concepts related to Object Oriented Programming. This item will be evaluated through theoretical questions where the student must clearly define the basic concepts related to OOP.

- **CO2** Identify and design class structures that support the solution of a given problem. This item will be evaluated in the first part, based on the models proposed by the students for the solution of problems given in class, which should follow the OOP paradigm.

- **CO3** Implement applications using a programming language, from the interpretation of a given diagram. This item will be assessed on all exams and on the lab project. Not only the operation of the application will be taken into account, but also if it complies with the OO programming paradigm and with the proposed model.

- **CO4** Formulate and execute a software engineering project, with specific roles and professional guidelines, following the Object-Oriented paradigm.

### ABET Student Outcome

**SO(2)** An ability to apply engineering design to produce solutions that meet specified needs with consideration of public health, safety, and welfare, as well as global, cultural, social, environmental, and economic factors. This item will be evaluated in the development of the final project, especially in compliance with the design requirements.

# Evaluations and policies

Below the items that will be part of the evaluation of this course. Please check the dates for each one of them on the course schedule


| Item 	| Weight 	|
|:---:	|:---:	|
| 1st partial Exam 	| 35% 	|
| Preliminary Project	| 10% 	|
| 2nd Partial Exam 	| 30% 	|
| Final Project	| 25% 	|

Please note that:

- All partial exams will be in-person
- Grammar and spelling are just as important as technical aspects.
- The works must be sent by the means specified.
- Send your work in advance, it is possible that a day before (or the day of) delivery there will be power failures.
- Remember, the university campus is enabled for you.
- All e-mail directed concerning the course must be sent specifying to which course do you belong. Answers are usually given within 24 hours. 

## Dev Environment

We will use:

- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/)
    - We have a [Github Repo](https://github.com/jdposada/oop_202230) with the code we will use during the course. The GitHub repo also has instructions to configure a local and a remote environment. 

## Final Project

Here is the [link](https://uninorte-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/jposada_uninorte_edu_co/Ef114mdBGmlJuyO8JpupvDYBau31DvzA5sEZ4dcdpVBAaw) with the document that delineates the final project. Feel free to add comments or ask in class if there is anything that does not seem clear to you

### Issues

If you have any issues with the Dev repo, please report it as a [Github Issue](https://github.com/jdposada/oop_202230/issues). In this way everyone that has the same problem will find the solution.

### Office Hours

Please check the Staff tab


### Ethical Code

**Plagiarism or any form of fraud will not be tolerated.**

Plagiarism will not be tolerated in this course. Without exception, if this situation arises, an investigation process involving the students implicated will start, and will act in accordance with the Student Regulations of the Universidad del Norte. 

Plagiarism includes: 
- Using content without proper reference
- Literally or with minimal changes that do not alter the spirit of the text
- Acquire with or without intention, works of third parties and present them partially or totally as their own
- Present group work where some of the members did not work or where there was no demonstrable teamwork
- Other situations defined in the academic [fraud manual of the Universidad del Norte](https://guayacan.uninorte.edu.co/normatividad_interna/upload/File/Guia_Prevencion_Fraude%20estudiantes(5).pdf)


Additionally, all work related to this subject:

- It must be done individually, unless the teacher indicates otherwise. Impersonation is a serious offense.
- It must be done in the time frame specified by the teacher.
- You must reference third-party libraries or algorithms that have been used in the source code.
- It must be sent by the means defined by the teacher (Brightspace/Google Forms). In case of not using the means established for the development of the course, it will be assumed that the work was not sent (this include e-mails).

### Students with Disabilities

Please let me know if you have any documented conditions and we will do our best to provide assistance
