# Course Description

In this course we study the concepts on which object oriented programming theory is centered, such as: abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, among others. This study of the topics is carried out through a gradual process from the concept of classes and objects to the construction of object-oriented software.

The course has two great moments. The first part is focused on giving the student the theoretical tools and principles for the design of solutions to problems, through UML diagrams and their implementation in software. In the second part, the student focuses on software development from a proposed design using standard design patterns, testing their ability to interpret the designs at the time of implementation.
